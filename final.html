    <p class="congratsparagraph"> 

    The orizuru (ori- “folded,” tsuru- “crane”), or paper crane, is a design that is considered to be the most classic of all Japanese origami. The crane is a traditional origami 
    figure, auspicious in Japanese culture. 
    Legend says that anyone who folds one thousand paper cranes 
    will have their heart’s desire come true.</p>
